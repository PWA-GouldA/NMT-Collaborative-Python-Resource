# (User Defined) Function Exercises

**There are many things to learn about functions, and I don't expect you to learn everything at once.** 
However, there are also many free exercises about defining functions you can do.

!!!! ### Exercise 01) Code Malfunction
!!!! **Filename:** ch02-userfunctions-01.py

What's wrong with this code?

    ```python
    def ask_name():
        name = input("Enter your name: ")

    ask_name()
    print("Your name is", name)
    ```

!!!! ### Exercise 02) Code Malfunction II
!!!! **Filename:** ch02-userfunctions-02.py

How about this code?

    ```python
    def get_greeting():
        return "Hello World!"

    print(get_greeting)
    ```

!!!! ### Exercise 03) Exercise Title
!!!! **Filename:** ch02-userfunctions-03.py

Why does this print None after greeting the world?

    ```python
    def greet(target):
        print("Hello", target)

    print(greet("World"))
    ```
